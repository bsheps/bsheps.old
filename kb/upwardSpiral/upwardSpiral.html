        <h2>Ch1 Understanding and awareness spiral</h2>
        <p>This chapter defines depression and anxiety. Main takeaway: both conditions are typically caused by an
            imbalance in the brain. This chapter also discusses brain anatomy:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dorsal Striatum - habitual part</li>
            <li>Nucleus accumbens - impulsive portion</li>
            <li>Amygdala - fear controller</li>
            <li>Hippocampus - main memory processor</li>
            <li>Insula - connection between mind and body. Creates physical feelings from emotions.</li>
            <li>Prefrontal Cortex - controls how we respond to stimuli, make plans and manage emotions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ch2 Activity spiral</h2>
        <p>Our activities affect our mood and doing the right activities can help you feel better over time. It's also
            important to recognize we can't always control our inner thoughts, but we can control the way we respond to
            them by identifying whether a given thought is useful or unhelpful. Thoughts do not define you.
        </p>

        <h2>Ch3 Movement spiral</h2>
        <p>Exercise is medicine for life. The body was made to move, so just do it.</p>
