        <p>Computers are literally everywhere and it's almost impossible to live without them in modern society. Even
             when we decide to go 'off grid', the things we take with us almost always interacted
            with a computer at some point. For example, think about your favorite shirt that you'll wear when camping... 
            The cotton -  
            picked by a massive computerized cotton picker tractor. Then processed in a computer automated mill. Then 
            it was shipped in a computerized delivery vehicle using computer tracking software. Eventually, it arrived 
            in the store where you bought it using your digital computer money. And when it got dirty, your washer/dryer
            computer helped clean and restore your favorite computer shirt.
